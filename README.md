# MLAlgos

This is a repository for different machine learning algorithms. The alogrithms are implemented on Python. Feel free to raise any issue or query!

## Setup:

To run the algorithms you would need the following libraries

*NumPy
*SciPy
*MatPlotLib
  
I have included other libraries for vscode. Feel free to customize your own environment.
Initialise a virtual environment and execute using ipython or any interpreter you are using.

Setup virtual environemnt:
```
virtualenv -p python3 folderName or .(for current directory)
```
Installing packages.```

Note: Make sure you initialise virtual env before installing them or it will install globally.
```
pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython pandas
```
for global installation
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython python-pandas
```
Note: You can directly install Anaconda or Canopy as they include a vast range of libraries you may or may not need.

Canopy: https://store.enthought.com/downloads/

### Running

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
```
cd to algo directory
```
```
ipython/python3 <scriptName>.py
```
